                    <h2>Population & Age</h2>
                    <div class="Population_Age">
                        <div style="margin-right: 25px;">
                            <p style="width: 450px;">Based on the following two visualizations, <span class="male_text">males</span> and <span class="female_text">females</span> in the entire Melbourne region are roughly balanced. According to the 2021 census report, there are 4,919,726 residents living in the Greater Melbourne Area. <span class="female_text">Females</span> make up about 1% more difference of the population (76,315) than <span class="male_text">males</span>.
                            This applies for most regions of the Greater Melbourne area.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Among all age groups, the most unbalanced age group is <span class="bold">85 years and over</span>, and the population of <span class="female_text">females</span> is almost twice that of <span class="male_text">males</span>. As can be seen from the idiom on the right, the <span class="bold">25-34 years</span> of the entire Melbourne area 
                                has the most residents in the entire Melbourne region and the least in the <span class="bold">85 years and over</span> age group.</p>    
                        </div>

                <div class="map_text">
                    <p>The map shows that Melbourne's <span class="density_l1">top(including top right) and bottom parts</span> are less densely populated, whereas the <span class="density_l3">central</span> <span class="density_l4">parts</span> are much more densely populated. <br><br>
                       Using the tooltip to compare, it can be seen that the density of the population in the <span class="bold">northwest</span> of Melbourne is the lowest, while the density in the <span class="density_l4">inner</span> part is the highest, with more than <span class="bold">16 times</span> difference.<br><br>
                       Moreover, <span class="bold">45-54 years</span> group dominates the inner south area, as opposed to <span class="bold">25-34 years</span> in average Melbourne areas, but similarly the majority of Melbourne's population falls into the <span class="bold">middle-aged age bracket</span> (25-44 years) age group based.

                            <p style="width: 450px;">Chart on the <span class="bold">right side</span> compares the population ranking up to 10 in 2021 census of countries where residents from overseas in Melbourne was raised. <br><br>By comparing with the census results of previous years, it can be found that the population ranking of Melbourne residents from <span class="China_text">China</span> and <span class="India_text">India</span> has increased in Melbourne. 
                            <br><br>The residents from <span class="India_text">India</span> come out on top among the many residents from overseas in 2021, having the population of <span class="bold">240 thousand</span>, which is far ahead of those from <span class="China_text">China</span> and <span class="UK_text">the United Kingdom</span>,whose population are both around <span class="bold">160 thousand</span>.

                        <p>By clicking on the <sapn class="bold">flag</sapn> above, we can observe people from <span class="China_text">China</span>, <span class="NZ_text">New Zealand</span> and <span class="India_text">India</span> have similar increasing trend. Little difference can be found that residents from
                            <span class="NZ_text">New Zealand</span> and <span class="India_text">India</span> moving to Melbourne started to increase since <sapn class="bold">1951-1960</sapn>, which is earlier than <span class="China_text">Chinese</span> people(started to increase arrival population since <span class="bold">1971-1980</span>).

                            <br><br>Interesting fact can be found that melbourne residents from European countries(<span class="Italy_text">Italy</span>, <span class="UK_text">the United Kimdom</span> and 
                            <span class="Greece_text">Greece</span>) from the top 10 experienced a slow decline in the number of residents moving to Melbourne over time, and they all reached a peak in moving to Melbourne during the <span class="bold">1961-1970 period.</span>
